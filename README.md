*Pronouns: she/they*

*Iâ€™m currently working on making my blog exist and my resources repository.*

Hello all! My name is Wynona and I'm a trans femme non-binary person who enjoys reading, sleeping and Computer-Science. I'm currenty "employed" as a freelance software dev where I work massive amounts of overtime and barely get paid. 

Besides the resource collecting project I'm also working on a personal blog where I want to post book reviews of Queer Theory as well as other stuff that I find interesting, but that's still a work in progress :)

You can find my blog [here](https://adittodevice.com/).

You can find me on reddit as [u/femm-andro](https://www.reddit.com/user/femm_andro).

**_Here's a fun fact; If you are wondering why my username has femm in it instead of femme it's because I came up with it in the dead of night and didn't realize I had mispelled it._**
