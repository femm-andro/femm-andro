### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello all! My name is Wynona and I'm a trans femme non-binary person who enjoys reading, sleeping and Computer-Science. I'm currenty "employed" as a freelance software dev where I work massive amounts of overtime and barely get paid. As stated in the introduction this was originaly created as a resource for myself and a few friends, but since then I have put a lot of time into making it something that is more generally applicable to the wider trans and non-binary community and something that is far more useful then the original pastebin.

Besides this project I'm working on a personal blog where I want to post book reviews of Queer Theory as well as other stuff that I find interesting, but that's still a work in progress :)

[Here's where the link to my blog would be if it existed]
